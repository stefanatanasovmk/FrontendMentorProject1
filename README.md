## My process

First I started with building the mobile version of the card, that was the easy part, I struggled a bit with adding an color over the picture, but I figure it out.

The stats on the card were the hardest to tackle I think, maybe because I started on the wrong foot, I started with making them as a <ul> and then when I wanted to make the desktop version of the card, I spent whole day figuring out how to make the <ul> inline, there were a lot of open tabs in my browser, a lot of sweat and sucking of my vipe, but the solution was simple, make the stats as a <div>, easier to shuffle them around as you please.

This was interesting, first time I'm making something with already given design and it feels great, because when previously I have tried to make something on my own, I always struggle with the design. Now I see why there is special proffesion called Web-Designer.

Also, I could add more width properties, for the website to be more compactabile with wider screens, but the point was the same, just needed to change the properties of other elements on the website on different widths, so I saw that pointless in the task. If you have a better solution of how to make the website more responsive without writing properties for many different widths, please suggest.

Also, I'm sorry if my spelling is wrong, I'm used to type English on my phone with auto-suggestion, so the spelling got worst over time, also I'm not a native. And, I'm sorry if you don't understand what I'm saying, because this "developer lingo" is very hard to understand with all the abreviations, and therms that doesn't make any sence.  

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

A bit more understanding of flexbox, even though I'm still not too much sure about what I'm doing when I write certain code. Sometimes I write something that I think that might work, and somehow it works, and I have no idea why. I have seen the memes that this is normal, but it feels like I don't really know what I'm doing. 

### Continued development

Gonna try some of the other options to practice HTML and CSS in Frotendmentor, and then continue with my learning. My next sections in my Udemy course are Bootstrap, which I already understand but gonna go trought the lectures, and JavaScript, language which I have not idea what it does exactly. 

### Useful resources

- StackOverFlow(https://stackoverflow.com/) - Literally however dumb my googling phrase looks like, just add CSS or HTML at the end of the phrase, someone have already asked that on this website.
- MDN Web Docs(https://developer.mozilla.org/) - The greatest resources on the internet.
